<br>
<h2>My body </h2>
<h3> <p>Your hair doesn't have to be straight or curly for it to be nice.Your skin doesn't have to be clear or bleached for you to look atractive.
  Your teeth doesn't have to be white for you to smile.Your nose doesn't have to be small or long for you to look breathtaking.</p>
  <p>Everything  on your body is there to compliment each other and work together like best friends. </p>
    <p>Your face is part of your identity but not part of who you are.</P></h3>

        <h2><p>Who am I?</p></h2>
          <p> well I can't answer that for you but I can help u answer it.</P>
    <p>You cannot be defined,you are you, you are unique , you make the world go round.</p>
    <p> Look in the mirror and ask yourself; who am I?.....can't answer the question ok, ask your friend/relative</p>
    <p> "Who am I? " They can come up with many words describing who you are or your personality but they can't tell you who you really are.</P>
      <p> Okay I will be your nail but you are the hammer....... in other words you are who you want yourself to be not what others think you are or </P>
        <p>what they want you to be ,you are simply yourself.</p

          <h1 id="randomnamehere"> Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, hair comes in different textures ,you are who you want yourself to be but
            let's not forget in one way or another we are all equal .Wealth, race, nationality doesn't change the fact that we are human. So share with
            one another, be someone's sunshine on a rainy day, we are our friend's keeper.</h1>
