  <h1> About this website </h1>
  <p>My name is Faith Raymond.I created this website to boost the self-confidence of women.
  We have been told for genarations that you have to be skinny to look beautiful
  in the eyes of the world well i'm here to tell you that is a lie.
  I hope that this website will change your perpective of the word "beatiful"and
  that you don't have to be a certain size or shape to be beautiful and that beauty comes from within.</p>
